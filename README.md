# Poke-A-Pup

Small game that is a challenge to click the dog picture as many times as you can.

Goals:

-Create backend with users that persist
-Use state to track the number of clicks in each round
-Make the dog move to random places on the screen
-Make the dog move faster and the game ends when the user can't click the dog because it moved too fast

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
